%!TEX root = ../DebrisCollision_ModellingAndSimulation_Report.tex

This is a report template to be used by members of SpaceHQ to create reports- it generously (or shamelessly)
borrows from \href{https://nasa.github.io/nasa-latex-docs/html/}{NASA-\LaTeX-Docs}.

With this \LaTeX package, the formatting is all handled internally so that report developers only need to
create their own content following a provided template (or even create their own). If not using a template
(example: AIAA or IEEE submission), this package also comes with an incredibly versatile, OS independent,
Python build script and Latexmk configuration file for easy document type-setting and warning/error detection.
